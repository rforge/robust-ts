Open issues:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
(1) Naming:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Setting the project's name to "robust-ts" is /not/
a final definition. As soon as there is an agreement
on this issue (see "Naming" on the project's home page
on R-forge) we want to adhere to the generally
accepted naming convention. So the name
"robust-ts" is just a working title.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
(2) Umbrella package
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

It would be nice to be able to group/bundle the development
of several R-packages under one umbrella.
This is not to be confused with an R-bundle like MASS
where these packages also ship out as this bundle ---
the packages should retain their separate lives ---
it is only to better coordinate development of packages that
are closely related to each other.
In our case this concerns packages robust-ts, robKalman and
Roland Fried's package on robust signal extraction.
It seems that the R-forge maintainers want to incorporate this
in the near future (see 3.2.1 in R-forge manual) --- so let's see...

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
(3) ([Semi-] automatic) maintenance of a target / todo list
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the banff workshop we have agreed upon a target list
of contents to be successively implemented / included to
this package. To avoid double work, the idea was that
anyone who is working on one item of the list is signalling
this to anyone else who might be interested in doing so.

So we would provide a maintained list, where this
"signallings" are gathered and which should be visible to
anyone browsing through the R-Forge pages, no matter
if he is subscribed to this project or not.
Subscribers however should get notified by e-mail on
every change of this list.

Now suppose someone new wants to contribute code; then he
subscribes to R-forge, sees this table, selects the topic to
work on; if someone else is working on it,  too, he simply
contacts this person by e-mail; else he simply inscribes
(or gets inscribed) into the table.

If someone stops working on this topic this should also be
signalled on this list.

So far this is only "planned" and we do not know the preferred
way to do this in R-forge. In this issue, I have contacted
Stefan Theussl, the person who is the admin of the R-forge
project, so let us hope that this sort of feature may even get
integrated to R-forge.
If not we could at least sort of manually maintain this list,
and provided there is not hundreds of volunteers, I think
this should not mean too much effort for the admin ---
but I may get disproved as to this.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
(4) Prominent place for  package guidelines and target list
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

So far we may easily insert these two lists into the package
home-page

http://robust-ts.r-forge.r-project.org/

but it would be nice to have them on the summary page
so that everyone entering the project will see this on first
sight.
